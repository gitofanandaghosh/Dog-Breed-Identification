# Dog-Breed-Identification
The goal is to build a model capable of doing breed classification of a dog by just “looking” into its image. I started thinking about possible approaches to build a model for doing this and what accuracy it might be able to achieve. It appears that with modern machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and publicly available datasets and pre-trained models for image recognition the task could be solved with a pretty good accuracy without applying too many efforts and spending too much time and resources.
